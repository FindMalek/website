### Undrstnd Developers: Revolutionizing AI Integration for Developers

**Undrstnd Developers** is a unified platform designed to simplify AI integration for developers by providing affordable and fast solutions. The project aims to deliver a high-quality product with a focus on reliability, efficiency, and security, making AI accessible to solo founders and small startups.

#### **Project Overview**

**Undrstnd Developers** was born out of the need for a cost-effective and efficient alternative to expensive AI services like OpenAI. The platform allows developers to manage AI API keys, track usage, and access comprehensive documentation, all while ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

- **Mission:** To provide easy, cheap, and fast AI integration for developers, making advanced AI technologies accessible to solo founders and small startups.

  - **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** For continuous integration and deployment.
  - **Trigger.dev (Background Jobs):** For managing background tasks and jobs.
  - **Stripe (Payments):** For secure and efficient payment processing.
  - **Dub (Short URLs):** For creating short and manageable URLs.
  - **Resend (Email):** For handling email communications.
  - **Vercel AI SDK (AI):** For advanced AI functionalities.

#### **Project History and Development**

The project began when I realized that OpenAI was charging excessively for slow inferences and expensive services. Inspired by this, I decided to create a more affordable and efficient alternative. The initial MVP used models from Groq, and the idea was validated with 50 active users in the first month, generating a profit of 200 euros.

- **Co-Founder and Investment:** I started the project with Denis Cartin as my co-founder, whom I met through Y Combinator Matchmaking. Although Denis left due to time constraints, we secured an investment of 5,000 USD from an investor in Qatar.
- **Transition to Solo Founder:** I am now working as a solo founder, focusing on developing our own models, `undrstnd-flash` and `undrstnd-thinking`, inspired by Mistral’s Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach.

#### **Impact and Achievements**

- **Cost-Effective Solution:** Undrstnd Developers offers AI integration at a significantly lower cost, approximately 80% cheaper than OpenAI, while being almost 120 times faster.
- **User Validation:** Successfully validated the idea with 50 active users in the first month and generated a profit of 200 euros.
- **Investment:** Secured an investment of 5,000 USD, demonstrating the project’s potential and viability.

#### **Future Plans**

- **Model Development:** Focus on developing and refining our own AI models, `undrstnd-flash` and `undrstnd-thinking`, to provide even better performance and affordability.
- **Expansion:** Continue to innovate and improve the platform, making it the go-to solution for solo founders and small startups seeking reliable and cost-effective AI integration.
