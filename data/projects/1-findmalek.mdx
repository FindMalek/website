# 🎨 FindMalek — Building My Digital Identity

Welcome to the story behind **[FindMalek](https://www.findmalek.com)** — a living, evolving digital space where I showcase not just my work, but my creative workflow, values, and personal growth as a builder.

This is my journey from concept sketches to launching **two full iterations** of this portfolio.

---

## 🌱 Version 1.0 — Humble Beginnings

The first iteration was built out of necessity. I needed a space to introduce myself to the world — fast, clean, and simple.

**My vision:**

> _Minimalist. Glossy. Easy to navigate. Fast._

The initial structure:

- **Landing Page**
- **About Me**
- **Projects**
- **Contact**

I started by browsing other portfolios, but nothing quite clicked. I wasn't a full-fledged dev yet — mostly a **UX designer and graphic artist** just starting to pick up **Next.js**, **React**, and experimenting with **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** when it was still in early beta.

### 📖 From Paper to Excalidraw

I went back to basics with paper sketches, then digitized them in **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)**. Unfortunately, my very first layout file is lost, but that was the spark.

**Planned layout flow:**  
**Introduction → About Me → Projects → Contact**

### 🎨 Designing the First UI in Figma

I spent hours in **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**, laying out clean, modern sections. I discovered a **Tailwind UI SVG background** that felt perfect:

Key design elements:

- **Glossy header navigation**
- **Background text** hinting at each page's content — subtle but intentional
- **Large hero image of myself** (because… why not?)

### 👉 Introducing the `NextPage` Component

To improve flow between sections, I created a **NextPage teaser component**:

> "Learn more about me →"

This gentle CTA bridged pages seamlessly.

### 📖 About Me

The page broke down:

- **Profile overview**
- **Ventures & Playlist** (because music fuels me)
- **Books I've read**

![About Me section](/project/findmalek-about-me.png)

### 💼 Projects Page

I added **interactive hover effects** for projects. On click, a **sheet opened with full details**.

I've kept this version online — a nostalgic, raw look at where it began.

## 🚀 Version 2.0 — Rethinking Everything

After two years of growing my skills and building client projects, it was time for a **serious glow-up**.  
I debated starting from scratch but chose to **refactor, redesign, and evolve**.

### ✏️ Planning the Revamp

I reopened **Excalidraw** to map a new information architecture.  
**Key upgrades:**

- Slimmed down layout containers from `max-w-lg` to `max-w-md` for an editorial, article-like feel
- Moved the **theme switcher** to the footer for a cleaner header

### 🔥 Major Page Improvements

**Home:**

- Cleaner, sharper hero
- A polished narrative

**Overview Cards:**

- Designed animated cards to showcase key sections
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for better engagement

**About:**

- Removed filler text
- Refined copy and layout

**Projects:**

- Split into **Projects (personal ventures)** and **Work (professional experience)**
- Each project now gets its own individual page (instead of sheets)

**New Sections:**

- **Experience**: Individual job/role pages
- **Clients**: My freelance and agency collaborations
- **[Stack](https://www.findmalek.com/stack)**: Tools & technologies I work with daily

### 🧠 The Contact Page Revolution

I hated basic forms.  
So I built an **AI-powered chatbot** using **[Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-ai-sdk)** with **tool calling**. It can:

- Send emails via **[Resend MCP](https://resend.com)**
- Book meetings using **[Cal.com](https://cal.com)**
- Share my resume
- Act like me, powered by my bio and details
- Help estimate project prices (fun to build!)

## 📚 Lessons & Reflections

- **Version 1**: It's okay to start rough. Your first portfolio doesn't need to be revolutionary.
- **Version 2**: Focus on incremental, thoughtful changes — small UX wins stack up.
- **AI tooling accelerates execution**.  
  [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Figma plugins](https://www.figma.com/community/plugins), and **Vercel AI SDK** saved me countless hours.
- Personal projects **matter more than you think** — they sharpen your design, dev, and problem-solving skills.
