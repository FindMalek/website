### Undrstnd Education: Revolutionizing Education with AI

**Undrstnd Education** is a groundbreaking platform designed to address the challenges of standardizing and managing educational content in universities. Developed as my final university project in collaboration with Amine Jguirim, this platform integrates features from Google Classroom and ChatGPT to create a seamless, AI-powered learning experience for both teachers and students.

#### **Project Inspiration**

The idea for **Undrstnd Education** was born out of a need to standardize and streamline the distribution of educational materials, such as courses and assignments, within universities. Recognizing the inefficiencies in current systems, we set out to create a stand-alone platform that combines the best features of Google Classroom and ChatGPT, making it accessible and free for all users.

#### **Platform Features**

- **Classroom Management:**

  - Teachers can create virtual classrooms and invite students using their university emails. Students can join automatically, ensuring a seamless onboarding process.
  - Teachers can upload files and documents, while students can react to, comment on, and download these materials, fostering interactive learning.

- **AI-Powered Interactions:**

  - The platform uses AI to scan uploaded files and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to feed the model with context from the files. This allows students to chat with the files, asking questions and receiving AI-generated responses based on the content.
  - Students can also upload their own files and interact with them using the AI features, enhancing their learning experience.

- **Free and Accessible:**
  - To ensure accessibility, especially for students who cannot afford expensive educational tools, we partnered with Groq. They provided full access to their AI models with no rate limits, allowing us to offer the platform completely free of charge.

#### **Technical Implementation**

The platform is built using a modern tech stack to ensure performance, scalability, and security:

- **Frontend:**
  - **React and Next.js:** For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
  - **TailwindCSS:** For creating a sleek and customizable design.
- **Backend:**
  - **TypeScript:** For robust and type-safe code.
  - **Prisma:** For efficient database management.
  - **AI Models (Groq):** For AI-powered interactions and content generation.
- **Hosting and Services:**
  - **Vercel:** For hosting and performance monitoring.
  - **PostgreSQL:** For reliable and scalable database solutions.
  - **GitHub (Codebase, Issues, PRs, Actions):** For version control and collaboration.

#### **Achievements**

- **First Place in University:**

  - The project was awarded first place in our university’s competition, recognizing its innovation and potential impact on education.

- **User-Friendly Design:**
  - The platform’s intuitive design and AI-powered features received positive feedback from both teachers and students, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience.
