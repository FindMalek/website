### JobFlow: Revolutionizing Job Matching Through Innovation

I joined **JobFlow** to lead the development of a cutting-edge job matching platform, focusing on enhancing user experience and optimizing algorithmic accuracy. My role involved shaping the direction of the platform's digital experiences and ensuring seamless integration of advanced technologies to solve real-world problems.

#### **Business Dashboard and Job Ads**
One of my primary responsibilities was working on the business dashboard, enabling companies to post job ads seamlessly. This involved creating intuitive interfaces and ensuring that the platform met the needs of both job seekers and employers. The dashboard was designed to streamline the process of posting job ads, making it easier for companies to attract top talent.

#### **Scraper and Database Integration**
I contributed to building a sophisticated scraper that extracted job listings from various sources and integrated them into our database using **Cron Jobs** and **Trigger.dev**. This system was powered by **MobX** and **tRPC**, and it operated within a **Turbo Repo** structure. The scraper significantly enhanced our database, ensuring that job listings were accurate and up-to-date, which improved the overall user experience.

#### **Technical Leadership and Migration**
One of my first tasks was migrating the project from **Yarn** to **pnpm**, a significant undertaking due to the project’s size and complexity. I successfully managed this transition, ensuring a smooth workflow for the team. This migration was crucial for improving the project’s performance and maintaining a modern development environment.

- **Bug Fixes and UI/UX Improvements:** Addressed critical bugs and made significant improvements to the user interface and user experience, ensuring a high-quality platform.

#### **Collaboration and Teamwork**
I actively collaborated with team members, providing code reviews, mentoring junior developers, and ensuring smooth project workflows. My contributions spanned bug fixes, feature enhancements, and performance optimizations, all aimed at delivering a robust and user-friendly job matching platform.
